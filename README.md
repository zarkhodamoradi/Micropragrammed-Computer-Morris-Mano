<h1 align="center">Microprogrammed Computer Design in Logisim</h1>

<p align="center">This project is a microprogrammed computer designed in Logisim, based on the principles outlined in Morris Mano's book . The microprogrammed computer serves as a basic educational tool for understanding computer architecture and microprogramming concepts.</p>

## Features

- **Microprogrammed Control Unit:** Utilizes microinstructions to control the execution of instructions.
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** Implements a simplified instruction set for basic computing tasks.
- **Register File:** Includes a set of registers for storing data and addresses.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.
- **Memory Unit:** Stores both instructions and data for program execution.
- **Input/Output Modules:** Allows interaction with external devices.
- **Clocking Mechanism:** Synchronizes the operations of various components.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Microprogrammed-computer-Moris-Mano.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Logisim:
    - Launch Logisim.
    - Open the main circuit file (`Microprogrammed Computer .circ`) located in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Open the Logisim project file (`Microprogrammed Computer .circ`).
2. Load a program into memory (if required).
3. Set any input values or initial conditions.
4. Run the simulation to observe the execution of the program.
5. Analyze the output and behavior of the microprogrammed computer.
