Microprogrammed Computer Design in Logisim
Overview
This project is a microprogrammed computer designed in Logisim, based on the principles outlined in Morris Mano's book [insert book title]. The microprogrammed computer serves as a basic educational tool for understanding computer architecture and microprogramming concepts.

Features
Microprogrammed Control Unit: Utilizes microinstructions to control the execution of instructions.
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): Implements a simplified instruction set for basic computing tasks.
Register File: Includes a set of registers for storing data and addresses.
ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): Performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.
Memory Unit: Stores both instructions and data for program execution.
Input/Output Modules: Allows interaction with external devices.
Clocking Mechanism: Synchronizes the operations of various components.
Installation
To use the microprogrammed computer design, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/microprogrammed-computer.git
Open the project in Logisim:

Launch Logisim.
Open the main circuit file (main.circ) located in the project directory.
Explore the design and experiment with different inputs and configurations.

Usage
Open the Logisim project file (main.circ).
Load a program into memory (if required).
Set any input values or initial conditions.
Run the simulation to observe the execution of the program.
Analyze the output and behavior of the microprogrammed computer.
